### Brief explanation

In my spider project, I'm creating a translation for my own language called Hado (not a coding language).
I'm still learning, so I'm tackling new topics that I haven't explored yet with Java.

### Technologies Used

| Java                                                                               | Maven                                                                                 | MariaDB                                                                                     |

#### HadoR translate screen

On the HadoR screen you can set Hado language back to your own language,
it works the same as on the Hado Screen.
